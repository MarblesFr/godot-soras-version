# Godot Engine Sora's Version

A Godot Engine fork that focuses on 2D pixel perfect games.

Features (WIP):
 * Positions of 2D nodes use ints
 * Overhauled 2D lighting system
 * Overhauled 2D physics system (based on [this](https://maddymakesgames.com/articles/celeste_and_towerfall_physics/index.html))

This fork changes/simplifies a lot of things, so a lot of features/components that are not relevant for my use case might no longer work.
